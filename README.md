## About Me

Passionate and inquisitive Life Sciences student at Hogeschool Utrecht, with a keen interest inunderstanding the intricacies of the human system and exploring the impact of data in medical research. Proficient in programming languages such as Python, R, and Bash, with a focus on data analysis and machine learning techniques. Experienced in volunteer social work, demonstrating strong communication, problemâ€‘solving, and emotional intelligence skills. Additionally, skilled in UI/UX design with experience using tools such as Figma. Seeking opportunities to merge my diverse skill set in Life Sciences, programming, design, and social work in impactful projects within the healthcare or research sector.


## Education

### Life Sciences: Medische en Biologische Onderzoek 

#### Hogeschool Utrecht, Heidelberglaan 7, 3584 CS Utrecht, Aug 2020 - Now

-  During this course, I specialized in using R and Bash to communicate statistical information about medical and scientific research. Additionally, I have developed skills in Next Generation Sequencing techniques, RNA-sequencing, and metagenomics.

### Minor: Big Data & Design

#### Hogeschool Utrecht, Heidelberglaan 15, 3584 CS Utrecht, Sep 2023 - Jan 2024

-  During this minor I learned to programming in python to communicate statistical information over the impact of data in our world. I also learned various Machine Learning techniques such as Classification algorithms and Generative AI and I develop multiple design skills in programs such as Figma where I learned the importance of design behind the development of applications and start-up ideas.

## Work Experience

### Social Work (Volunteer) 

#### The Mall Jongerenwerk Gorinchem, Burgstraat 37, 4201 AB Gorinchem,  Jan 2019 - Now

-  I offered crucial emotional support to youth with special needs, empowering them to achieve developmental milestones and embrace healthy habits. I organized and led activities focused on mental, emotional, and educational growth, collaborating with parents, teachers, and school staff to address educational issues effectively.

### Verkoopassistentie

#### Fruit Company, Gorinchem, Sep 2022 - Jul 2023

-   I handled inventory management and supported the sales team's daily activities. I provided customer advice both in person and through phone and email communication. Additionally, I performed various administrative tasks as required.

### Productie Medewerker

-  I helped machine operators with setting up and running production equipment. This involved moving items between equipment and cleaning work areas. I quickly solved problems to meet productivity goals.",

## Personal Achievements

### App development (Medipredict)

In the past year, I developed my startup idea with two classmates: [*Pim Theunisse*](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pim-theunisse-6b7898208/) and [*Marloes Ettikhoven*](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marloes-v-7a620a135/). For this startup idea, we developed the design and algorithm for an app with the main purpose of predicting various diseases. The name of this app was **Medipredict**. For this project I had the leadership of this project group and collaborated on the training and testing of the algorithm model that this app should use. Finally I also contributed to the UI/UX design for this app. Here are the links to both the **Jupyter Notebook** and the **Figma website** where the entire development process of this app is documented:

### Data Story

To test the Python skills I learned during my minor, I challenged myself to develop a Streamlit app where I tell a story using public data. I chose to focus on how climate change affects the increasing prevalence of diseases such as **malaria**. Developing this data story marked my initial step in my data analysis career. Here is the link to the Streamlit app containing this data story.

### Hackathon

After completing my data story, I participated in a Hackathon for the company [**Digiredo**](https://www.digiredo.nl/). I collaborated with a team to develop a Streamlit app for the company aimed at facilitating communication of various data with their clients. After one week of intense work, I'm proud to say that my team and I won first place in the hackathon. Due to privacy and copyright reasons, I'm unable to share this Streamlit app.

### Event organization

During my time as a volunteer social worker, I was responsible for organizing an important meeting event for [**The Mall Jongerenwerk Gorinchem**](https://mallgorinchem.nl/). For this event, I led a group of 6 individuals aged between 13 and 30 years old. I coordinated various tasks such as cooking, entertainment, and welcoming. The event was attended by 60 people, and afterward, I received positive feedback from the majority of the attendees.
