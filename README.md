### Medipredict

In the past year, I developed my startup idea with two classmates: [*Pim Theunisse*](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pim-theunisse-6b7898208/) and [*Marloes Ettikhoven*](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marloes-v-7a620a135/). For this startup idea, we developed the design and algorithm for an app with the main purpose of predicting various diseases. The name of this app was **Medipredict**. For this project I had the leadership of this project group and collaborated on the training and testing of the algorithm model that this app should use. Finally I also contributed to the UI/UX design for this app. Here are the links to both the **Jupyter Notebook** and the **Figma website** where the entire development process of this app is documented:

### Data Story

To test the Python skills I learned during my minor, I challenged myself to develop a Streamlit app where I tell a story using public data. I chose to focus on how climate change affects the increasing prevalence of diseases such as **malaria**. Developing this data story marked my initial step in my data analysis career. Here is the link to the Streamlit app containing this data story.

### Hackathon

After completing my data story, I participated in a Hackathon for the company [**Digiredo**](https://www.digiredo.nl/). I collaborated with a team to develop a Streamlit app for the company aimed at facilitating communication of various data with their clients. After one week of intense work, I'm proud to say that my team and I won first place in the hackathon. Due to privacy and copyright reasons, I'm unable to share this Streamlit app.

### Event organization

During my time as a volunteer social worker, I was responsible for organizing an important meeting event for [**The Mall Jongerenwerk Gorinchem**](https://mallgorinchem.nl/). For this event, I led a group of 6 individuals aged between 13 and 30 years old. I coordinated various tasks such as cooking, entertainment, and welcoming. The event was attended by 60 people, and afterward, I received positive feedback from the majority of the attendees.
